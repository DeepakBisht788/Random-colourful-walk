# Random Color Turtle Drawing
This project uses Python's `turtle` graphics library to create a fun, colorful drawing where a turtle moves randomly and changes its color with each step. The result is a dynamic and unique design generated every time the program runs.

## Features
- **Random Movement:** The turtle moves in random directions (up, down, left, right).
- **Random Colors:** The turtle’s pen color is changed to a random RGB value on each move.
- **Customizable Speed and Pen Size:** You can adjust the speed of the turtle's movement and the thickness of the lines drawn.

## How It Works
1. The turtle is initialized with a shape and an initial color.
2. The turtle moves forward by 30 units at a time.
3. A random RGB color is assigned to the turtle before each move.
4. The turtle randomly changes direction between 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°.
5. This process repeats 100 times, generating a random, colorful pattern.
